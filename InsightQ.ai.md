The $10 Million Question Traditional AI Can't Answer  
* Font: 56px, Weight 800, Color: #1a237e  
**Problem Statement (Card-based layout, staggered fade-in):**  
Card 1: 🔴 **Strategic Blindness**  
  
  
Traditional AI treats information as isolated snippets, creating a   
"black box" that prevents multi-hop reasoning across non-linear   
dependencies.  
Card 2: 🔴 **Trust Gap**  
  
  
No verifiable audit trail for high-stakes decisions. Decision-makers   
are forced to trust probabilistic guessing in scenarios where being   
wrong costs millions.  
Card 3: 🔴 **Fragmented Reality**  
  
  
Data trapped in silos across departments. The connective tissue   
between critical business insights simply doesn't exist.  
**Stats Counter (Animated count-up on scroll into view):**  
* 7 hops: Maximum reasoning depth  
* 0% hallucination rate  
* 85% faster: Than manual analysis

The Graph That Thinks  
**Content:**  
  
  
Unlike traditional vector databases that measure "similarity," our Knowledge   
Graph creates explicit, deterministic relationships between entities.  
  
- Multi-dimensional edge types (causal, temporal, hierarchical)  
- Real-time graph updates as new data flows in  
- Bi-directional relationship traversal  
- Weighted confidence scores on every edge  
  
The result? An AI that doesn't guess—it knows.  
**Technical Specs (Animated counter):**  
* 10M+ nodes per enterprise deployment  
* <100ms query response time  
* 99.9% relationship accuracy

Verification Loop:  
1. Query decomposition into sub-questions  
2. Multi-source document retrieval  
3. Cross-reference with Knowledge Graph  
4. Conflict resolution & fact-checking  
5. Provenance trail generation  
6. Human-verifiable output
