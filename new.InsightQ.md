InsightQ.ai - Premium Website Design Specification (Revised)
Inspired by gentlerain.ai's Excellence

🎨 DESIGN PHILOSOPHY SHIFT
After analyzing gentlerain.ai, here's what makes it exceptional that we need to adopt:
Key Observations:
1. Extreme minimalism - Massive whitespace, brutally simple
2. Type-first design - Typography does 80% of the heavy lifting
3. Subtle micro-animations - Not overwhelming parallax everywhere
4. Product-led - Shows the actual interface, not abstract concepts
5. Conversational copy - Speaks human, not corporate
6. Fast loading - Minimal assets, maximum impact
Our New Direction:
* Less visual noise, more breathing room
* Show actual InsightQ interface screenshots
* Cleaner, more confident copy
* Parallax only where it truly adds value (hero + 2 key sections)
* Mobile-first thinking

THE $10M PROBLEM
Headline:


Traditional AI is playing telephone 
with your most critical decisions
* Font: 56px
* Weight: 700
* Color: #1a1a1a
Body Copy (3 short paragraphs):


Standard AI treats information as isolated snippets. Ask it to connect 
the dots 5 steps away, and it starts making things up.

In M&A due diligence, drug discovery, or supply chain analysis, 
"probably correct" isn't good enough. The cost of being wrong is measured 
in tens of millions.

That's not an AI problem. That's an architecture problem.
* Font: 20px
* Line-height: 1.8
* Color: #374151
* Max-width: 560px
Right Column (50%):
Visual - Animated Comparison:


IMAGE PROMPT: "Clean comparison diagram, minimal style, white background. 
TOP: 'Standard AI' shows disconnected floating data nodes with question marks 
and dashed lines between them (gray/red color scheme). BOTTOM: 'InsightQ' shows 
the same nodes connected by solid orange lines forming clear paths, with 
checkmarks. Simple, clean, professional infographic style, lots of whitespace."

[Large quote mark icon]

"The difference between InsightQ and ChatGPT isn't speed or features. 
It's that one is probabilistic guessing, and one is deterministic proof.

When you're analyzing a ₹500 crore acquisition, that difference 
matters."

🔬 SECTION 7: THE TECHNOLOGY (Simplified)
Background: White
Layout: Two-column split
Left: Knowledge Graph Explanation
Headline:


The graph that refuses to hallucinate
* Font: 48px
Body:


Traditional AI uses vector similarity: "These words seem related, 
so the answer is probably..."

InsightQ uses explicit relationships: "Entity A is connected to 
Entity B through verified Edge C. Confidence: 97%. Source: 
Document D, Page 12."

One is a guess. One is proof.
Technical Specs (Clean list):


- 10M+ nodes per enterprise deployment
- <100ms query response time
- 99.9% relationship accuracy
- Real-time graph updates
- Bi-directional traversal
- Weighted confidence scoring
Right: Interactive Graph Demo


IMAGE PROMPT: "Clean knowledge graph interface showing interconnected nodes, 
clicking on one node highlights its connections and shows metadata panel, 
professional SaaS UI design, navy and orange color scheme, realistic product 
interface, labels visible"
* Consider making this actually interactive (Three.js or D3.js)
* Or high-quality animated GIF showing interaction

Second Row: RAG + Verification
Right: Diagram


IMAGE PROMPT: "Simple flowchart showing: User Query → Semantic Search → 
Document Retrieval → Knowledge Graph Verification → Provenance Generation 
→ Verified Output. Clean boxes connected by orange arrows, icons in each 
box, white background, professional infographic"
Left: Explanation
Headline:


RAG that verifies every claim
Body:


Our Agentic RAG doesn't just retrieve documents. It cross-references 
every claim against the Knowledge Graph before presenting results.

If sources conflict, we show you both. If confidence is low, we tell 
you. If the graph doesn't support a claim, we don't make it.

No black boxes. No "trust me." Just transparent, verifiable reasoning.

* Smooth animation
* Plus icon → Minus icon on expand
Questions:
1. How is this different from ChatGPT?


ChatGPT uses probabilistic generation—it predicts the most likely next 
words based on patterns. InsightQ uses deterministic reasoning—it traces 
explicit relationships through a verified knowledge graph. 

When analyzing a ₹50 crore deal, "most likely" isn't good enough. You 
need provable, auditable truth.
2. How long does implementation take?


Pilot programs: 2-4 weeks
Full enterprise deployment: 6-8 weeks

We handle data connectors, API integrations, and custom workflows. Your 
team focuses on defining business rules and validation criteria.
3. Do we need to migrate our existing data?


No. InsightQ connects to your existing systems via APIs and 
real-time sync. Your data stays where it is—we just create the 
connective tissue between silos.
4. What if our data is highly sensitive?


On-premise deployment available. Your data never leaves your 
infrastructure. We can deploy on your private cloud or air-gapped 
environment.

SOC 2 Type II certified. GDPR compliant. Zero-knowledge architecture.
5. How does pricing scale?


Based on protected revenue or deal volume, not user seats. As your 
business grows, the platform's value grows with it. No per-seat 
nickel-and-diming.
6. Can we start with a pilot?


Yes. Most clients start with a ₹15-60L pilot focused on a single 
high-stakes use case. Prove ROI first, then scale across the 
organization.
7. What kind of support do you provide?


Dedicated account team, 24/7 technical support for enterprise clients, 
quarterly business reviews, and a customer success manager who knows 
your business.
8. What's your accuracy rate?


<0.1% hallucination rate across all deployments. 99.9% relationship 
accuracy in the knowledge graph. If we're not confident, we tell you 
instead of guessing.
