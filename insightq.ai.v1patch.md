❌ Risk: $10M bad decision

InsightQ shows:
[Visual provenance trail with 7 nodes]

🔥 THE BIGGEST MISS: INTERACTIVE DEMO
If I had to pick ONE thing you're missing, it's this:
Award-winning sites (Apple, Nike) let you EXPERIENCE the product immediately.
Your site is beautiful but passive. Add:

An embedded "Try It Now" sandbox
Pre-loaded realistic data
User can ask questions
See provenance trail generate live
"Wow" moment in 30 seconds

This single addition could 3x your conversion rate.
